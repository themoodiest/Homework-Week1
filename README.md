# Truesy and the Fashion Revolution

  During these innovative times, many industries are using technological advancements to expand their reach. The fashion industry is one of those industries. Companies such as Gucci, Burberry, and Louis Vuitton are embracing the uprise of blockchain and crypto currency transactions to increase their digital influence. In a world where more and more people are joining the metaverse, fashion brands are utilizing NFTs to enter the growing digital world. Truesy is a new NFT marketplace that is giving artists and brands an opportunity to sell on a highly curated platform. 
  
  Truesy was founded by Marc Beckman- cofounder of creative agency DMA United- in May of 2021 (McDowell & Benissan, 2021). With the help of TQTezos, a tech company that builds Tezos-based solutions, Truesy was created to provide artists a very personal and curated experience while selling their NFTs. Sellers on Truesy can create a new type of NFT called a “dynamic NFT,” which allows for the product to be upgradeable throughout its lifetime. Truesy is meant to attract customers that can spend cryptocurrency but also those who can only pay in national currency.  It is also said to be a more ecofriendly marketplace since it is built on the Tezos blockchain, which uses “…very little energy, especially compared to other large Blockchains” (Walters, 2021). According to Chris Carella, Product Lead at Truesy, the new marketplace is meant to offer five major solutions: to be highly curated, offer personal gallery-like displays for the artists who sell on the platform, be ecofriendly and sustainable, create unique products such as dynamic NFTs, and be a user-friendly platform (Mangiero, 2021).  
  
  In an interview with the president of TQTezos, Carella explained that as an artist he was looking for a way to authenticate his artworks. With his professional background in tech apps, computer science and blockchain, he knew that he wanted to build an app on a blockchain platform. Due to its ecofriendliness, TQTezos was the tech company of choice to help him develop Truesy. DMA United
